  As usual, after {settings.minActiveTime} minutes of activity, grab some well
  deserved {settings.restForMinActiveTime} minutes of rest.
</p>
<p>
  If you're in the middle of something when the time is up, you can carry on (up
  to a total of {settings.maxActiveTime} minutes of activity)!
  <strong>The rest time will grow accordingly!</strong>
